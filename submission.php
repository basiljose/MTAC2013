                        Prospective authors are invited to submit
                        full-length original research papers.  The
                        conference proceedings will be published and 
						distributed to the authors during the conference. The
                        authors can also submit supplementary
                        materials along with their papers.  In
                        submitting a manuscript to MTAC, authors
                        acknowledge that no paper substantially
                        similar in content has been or will be
                        submitted to another journal, or conference or
                        workshop during the review period. In such a
                        case the paper will be rejected without
                        review. Papers must be electronically submitted
                        before the deadline expires without exception.

                            Since the review process is double blind,
                            the <strong>identity of the authors

                            the manuscript. Also, please name your
                            manuscript pdf file in a manner that
                            does not reveal the authors' . In

                            Use a proper tool to convert the resulting

                          Microsoft CMT submission portal on or before
                          paper deadline. The portal can be accessed

                            details and affiliations while
                            registering. Once an account is created

                            author console, where you can create a new

                          A single account can be used for
                          submitting multiple papers. The above
                          procedure has to be repeated for each new
                          submission.

                          Authors can edit manuscript-related
                          information and re-upload the pdf manuscript
                          any number of times <strong>before the paper

			  Authors can use the reset password link on

			  The co-author accounts are created if their
