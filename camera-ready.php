		     We provide the main steps, as well as detailed
                     instructions for preparing the final

                          all fonts embedded. Be particularly careful
                          of fonts in figures and images.
			</li>
			<br/>
			<li>
			  Rename the resulting file name as
			  FirstAuthorLastName.PaperId.pdf (e.g., if the
			  first author name is Tim Sharma and the
			  paper ID is 21, then the file name should be
			  Sharma.21.pdf)
                        </li>
